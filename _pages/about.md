I am a MSAA student in the [Autonomous Controls Lab](https://uwacl.com) at the University of Washington, advised by Professor [Behçet Açikmeşe](https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/behcet-acikmese). My research is focused on full-stack innovation of autonomous unammed aerial systems (UAS), from vehicle design to feedback control and trajectory planning algorithms. I am particularly interested in improving the flight envelope for high-speed and hyper-agile systems. 

I graduated with distinction with a BASc from the [Engineering Physics](https://www.engphys.ubc.ca/) program at the University of British Columbia in 2022. I completed two years of internships during my undergraduate studies, including:
- Steering firmware integration at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com)
- Safe RL algorithm research under Professor [Maryam Kamgarpour](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m6YgGqAAAAAJ&hl=en) at UBC
- Algorithm development for smart agriculture at [Verdi](https://www.verdi.ag)
- Polymer MEMS ultrasound integration at [Sonus Microsystems](https://sonusmicrosystems.com)
- Intrumentation engineering at [Precision NanoSystems (now Cytiva)](https://www.cytivalifesciences.com/en/us/solutions/bioprocessing/services/nanomedicine-development-and-manufacturing/lipid-nanoparticle-portfolio)

I am always looking for exciting projects, collaborations and opportunities. If you would like to get in touch, please reach out via email at jasonzhou0404[at]gmail[dot]com.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.  -->
